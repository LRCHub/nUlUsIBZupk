[00:34.84] In the back of the bar
[00:38.37] You're talking to me with the lights on
[00:41.77] You told me love don't exist
[00:45.48] And if it does, it doesn't last long
[01:03.48] 
[00:49.13] And in the city, it hits
[00:52.63] I said, "Let's drink until the last call"
[00:56.38] I know you're leaving with him
[00:59.86] But can you wait until the last song?
[01:18.36] 
[01:04.02] And I know what your summertime friends have to say about me
[01:08.37] But you always want to see me again
[01:11.83] This should be the last time you're gonna leave without me
[01:15.86] The last time you call me a friend
[01:32.86] 
[01:19.20] And oh, whoa, and I get so mad that we're not together
[01:26.67] And oh, whoa, yeah, I want you bad
[01:43.67] 
[01:32.53] It doesn't matter where you are
[01:40.46] Don't leave
[01:46.76] It doesn't matter where you are
[01:54.91] Don't leave
[02:00.41] 
[02:01.39] We're in the back of your car
[02:04.83] You're telling me it's not the right time now
[02:08.52] But you can never decide
[02:12.27] For tonight, can you just say I'm right, say I'm right, say I'm right?
[02:47.27] 
[02:16.72] And oh, whoa, yeah, I get so mad that we're not together
[02:24.53] And oh, whoa, yeah, I want you bad
[02:41.53] 
[02:30.04] It doesn't matter where you are
[02:38.34] Don't leave
[02:44.49] It doesn't matter where you are
[02:52.69] Don't leave
[02:58.19] 
[03:00.49] And oh, whoa, and I get so mad that we're not together
[03:07.86] And oh, yeah, I want you bad
[03:21.86] 
[03:31.06] (Yeah) peace (whoo, whoo)
[03:34.93] Was fun (yeah)
[03:36.24] Turn it off
